h1. PLDocpldoc is an open-source utility for generating HTML documentation of code written in Oracle PL/SQL. The goal is to provide a tool analogous to javadocfor Java.The PLDoc source code on github was once fetched from the original pldoc project located at sourceforge, http://pldoc.sourceforge.net. The branchwas made when I wanted to make some bigger changes, and needed a place towork. Hey, nothing beats github for that!Eirik
